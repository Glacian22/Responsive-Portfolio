                <p class="text">I've always felt that the world is just so full of things. Great things, horrifying things, too many to possibly experience in a lifetime. That's probably why my apartment is home to several musical intruments, some karate weaponry, a couple of 3D printers, and a metric ton of books. Also two cats, who help out during computer time by bopping me with their paws at random intervals.</p>
                <p class="text">Fun fact about me: there are many fun facts about me! Many are common-level rarity, like my story about a humorous encounter with a baby moose. But for the rare, or even the highly coveted ultra-rare facts? Those are only available in person, as specified by the International Fun Fact Treaty of 1722.</p>
